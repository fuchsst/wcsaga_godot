- Complete BSP tree handling and optimization
- GLTF conversion with proper coordinate transforms
- Robust error handling and progress reporting
- Comprehensive documentation
- Performance optimizations

Next focus should be on:
1. review pof_converter.py
2. refactor pof_file_viewer.py to use our new implementation
3. add proper debug logging
4. run our script against files from wing commander saga
