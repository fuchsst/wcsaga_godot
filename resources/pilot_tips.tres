Try staying out of their way, if possible.", "Capship Anti-Matter batteries typically aren't fast enough to target you, but their tachyon batteries can. They are the white bolts that strip away your shields after a few hits.", "Getting hit by missiles is a bad thing.", "Please try to keep your wingmen alive. It gives the Kilrathi another target to shoot at.", "Incoming fire works both ways.", "Attacking heavy fighters and torpedo bombers from the rear probably isn't the best approach of attack, since they got rear turrets and all.", "Take care of your capship, and your capship will take care of you.", "If your radar is jammed, there's probably an electronic warfare craft loitering around.", "The Kilrathi is never as dumb as you hoped.", "There is no such thing as too many missiles.", "There are never enough decoys.", "Enemy capships have point defense systems that can shoot down torpedoes. Release your warheads appropriately. Oh, and try not to get caught up in the blast will ya?", "Kilrathi Aces are generally not social and friendly folk, and should be treated accordingly.", "When you see a Kilrathi dreadnought, RUN!", "If you spend way too much time trying to chase down a light fighter, chances are his buddy is sneaking up on you.", "If you're in a light fighter, don't fight head on with a heavy fighter. You won't win.", "If the Kilrathi are in missile range, so are you!", "The easy nav route is always mined.", "All warfare is based on deception. The main challenge is being able to fool the Kilrathi and not yourself.", "Your shields failing is usually a sign that you're being fired upon.", "The bigger the carrier, the more torpedoes the Kilrathi will launch at it.", "Don't think of it as being outnumbered, Think of it as having a wider target selection.", "A retreating Kilrathi squadron is really falling back and regrouping... and calling in for backup.", "When you have plenty of missiles, you never miss. When you're low on missiles, you can't hit the broadside of a dreadnought.", "There's always a way to defeat the Kilrathi, and it normally doesn't work.", "Ejecting right before the Kilrathi destroys your fighter typically means you have 10 more seconds to live.", "The cavalry doesn't always come to the rescue.", "The capship that usually blows up when you need it most is the carrier.", "If your ambush is properly set, the Kilrathi won't fly into it.", "If your attack is going well, it is an ambush.", "When unsure of the enemy fighter's location, look behind you.", "The Kilrathi always attacks on two occasions. One is when you're ready. The second is when you aren't.", "Try to look unimportant. They may be low on missiles.", "Anything you do can get you killed, including nothing.", "The only thing more accurate then incoming enemy fire, is incoming friendly fire.", "No combat ready squadron has passed inspection.", "No inspection ready squadron has passed combat.", "Shipkiller torpedoes are very accurate. They always hit the Kilrathi's point defense laser blasts.", "Don't look conspicuous, it draws fire.", "Never draw fire. It irritates everyone around you.", "If you're short of everything but the enemy, you're in a combat zone.", "Friendly fire isn't.", "Incoming fire has the right of way.", "Your fighter was bought by the lowest bidder."])
