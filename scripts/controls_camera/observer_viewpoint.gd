extends Node3D
class_name ObserverViewpoint

## Represents an observer viewpoint in the game world.
## Corresponds to the observer object type in C++.
## Primarily used as a positional/orientational marker.

# --- State ---
# Corresponds to observer struct fields (if needed)
var target_obj_id: int = -1 # Optional: If observers need to track targets
var observer_flags: int = 0 # Optional: For any specific observer state flags

# --- Methods ---

# Corresponds to observer_get_eye()
func get_eye_transform() -> Transform3D:
	return global_transform

# Corresponds to observer_create() - Instantiation handles creation
# Corresponds to observer_delete() - queue_free() handles deletion

# Add any specific logic for observer viewpoints if required later.
# The original C++ code suggests minimal functionality beyond existing as an object.
