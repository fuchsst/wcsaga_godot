# Physics Optimization Package - OBJ-007 Physics Step Integration and Performance

## Purpose

- Combat priority system for objects in active engagement
- Object type considerations (weapons vs ships vs debris)

### AC3: Update Frequency Groups ✅
- HIGH_FREQUENCY: 60 FPS (every frame) - Player ship, immediate threats
- MEDIUM_FREQUENCY: 30 FPS (every 2 frames) - Nearby objects, active combat
- LOW_FREQUENCY: 15 FPS (every 4 frames) - Distant objects, background elements  
- MINIMAL_FREQUENCY: 5 FPS (every 12 frames) - Very distant objects, inactive elements

### AC4: Physics Culling System ✅

- Smart culling rules (never cull player, active combat, or weapons)
- Automatic uncling when objects become relevant again
- Performance impact tracking for culled vs active objects

### AC5: Performance Monitoring ✅
- Real-time physics step timing measurement
- Frame rate tracking with 60-sample rolling average
- Physics budget exceeded detection and counting
- Comprehensive performance statistics via `get_performance_stats()`

### AC6: Automatic Optimization ✅
- Triggered by low FPS (<50), physics budget violations, or high object count (>150)
- Automatic LOD threshold reduction (20% decrease) during optimization
- Frame rate sample analysis for trend detection
- Optimization reason tracking and logging

## WCS C++ Source Analysis
Enhanced existing PhysicsManager based on WCS physics.cpp analysis:
- **apply_physics()**: Core WCS exponential damping algorithm already implemented
- **Fixed Timestep**: 60Hz fixed timestep matching WCS physics frequency
- **Performance Constants**: Uses WCS physics constants (ROTVEL_CAP, MAX_SHIP_SPEED, etc.)
- **Distance Optimization**: Added LOD system not present in original WCS

## Architecture Integration

### PhysicsManager Enhancements
```gdscript
# OBJ-007 LOD Physics Optimization System
var lod_enabled: bool = true
var player_position: Vector3 = Vector3.ZERO
var lod_object_data: Dictionary = {}  # object_id -> LODObjectData
var frame_rate_samples: Array[float] = []
var automatic_optimization_enabled: bool = true

# LOD Distance Thresholds (tuned for WCS)
var near_distance_threshold: float = 2000.0   # HIGH to MEDIUM transition
var medium_distance_threshold: float = 5000.0  # MEDIUM to LOW transition  
var far_distance_threshold: float = 10000.0   # LOW to MINIMAL transition
var cull_distance_threshold: float = 20000.0  # Physics culling threshold
```

### LOD Object Data Structure
```gdscript
class LODObjectData:
    var object: RigidBody3D
    var object_type: ObjectTypes.Type
    var current_frequency: UpdateFrequencies.Frequency
    var last_distance: float
    var is_culled: bool
    var last_update_frame: int
    var update_interval_frames: int
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic LOD System Integration
```gdscript
# PhysicsManager automatically handles LOD for registered space objects
PhysicsManager.register_space_physics_body(ship, physics_profile)

# Set player position for distance calculations
PhysicsManager.set_player_position(player.global_position)

# Force LOD recalculation if needed
PhysicsManager.force_lod_recalculation()
```

### Performance Monitoring
```gdscript
# Get comprehensive performance statistics
var stats: Dictionary = PhysicsManager.get_performance_stats()

# LOD-specific metrics
var lod_objects_tracked: int = stats.lod_objects_tracked
var lod_objects_culled: int = stats.lod_objects_culled
var frequency_counts: Dictionary = stats.lod_frequency_counts
var average_fps: float = stats.average_fps

# LOD thresholds
var thresholds: Dictionary = stats.lod_thresholds
print("Cull distance: ", thresholds.cull)
```

### Automatic Optimization Control
```gdscript
# Enable/disable automatic optimization
PhysicsManager.automatic_optimization_enabled = true

# Manual optimization trigger
PhysicsManager._apply_automatic_optimization("MANUAL", 45.0)

# LOD system control
PhysicsManager.set_lod_optimization_enabled(true)
```

### Object Type Considerations
```gdscript
# Objects provide engagement status for LOD priority
func get_engagement_status() -> String:
    return "ACTIVE_COMBAT"  # High priority
    return "PEACEFUL"       # Normal priority

# Player objects are never culled
func is_player() -> bool:
    return true  # Never culled

# Object type affects culling rules
func get_object_type() -> ObjectTypes.Type:
    return ObjectTypes.Type.WEAPON  # Never culled (short lifetime)
```
