# Game Flow Package - EPIC-007 Implementation

## Package Overview
Core game flow and state management systems extending existing foundation with comprehensive campaign progression, mission execution, and player career tracking.

## Components

### State Management (FLOW-001, FLOW-002, FLOW-003)
- **Enhanced GameStateManager**: Extended with new game flow states 
- **State Transition Validation**: Advanced validation with error recovery
- **Session Management**: Session lifecycle coordination with existing SaveGameManager

### Campaign System (FLOW-004, FLOW-005, FLOW-006)
- **Campaign Progression Manager**: Central campaign coordinator using existing CampaignData/CampaignState
- **Mission Unlocking**: Intelligent mission availability logic with multiple unlock types
- **Campaign Variables**: Enhanced variable management with validation and history
- **Mission Context Management**: Seamless mission flow integration through all phases

### Player Data (FLOW-007, FLOW-008, FLOW-009)
- **Pilot Data Coordinator**: Central hub extending existing PlayerProfile/PilotStatistics
- **Achievement Manager**: Comprehensive achievement and medal system (12 achievements, 6 medals)
- **Performance Tracker**: Historical tracking with trend analysis and comparative metrics
- **Save Flow Coordination**: Enhanced save/load coordination with existing SaveGameManager
- **Backup Systems**: Intelligent backup automation and recovery assistance

### Scoring System (FLOW-010)
- **Mission Scoring Engine**: Real-time performance evaluation and comprehensive scoring
- **Performance Tracker**: Detailed combat effectiveness and mission performance metrics
- **Statistics Aggregator**: Career statistics accumulation with weapon/target proficiency tracking
- **Scoring Configuration**: Flexible scoring parameters with difficulty-based multipliers

## Key Features

### Mission Scoring (FLOW-010)
Real-time mission performance evaluation with:
- Multi-factor scoring (kills, objectives, survival, efficiency)
- Configurable difficulty multipliers and mission-type adjustments
- Detailed performance analytics with weapon proficiency tracking
- Achievement progress integration and career statistics aggregation

### Achievement System
- **Combat**: First kill, ace pilot, centurion, marksman
- **Mission**: Rookie graduate, veteran pilot, perfect mission  
- **Campaign**: Campaign hero, saga legend
- **Survival**: Survivor, iron man
- **Special**: Speed demon, fleet defender

### Performance Analytics
- **Trend Analysis**: Improving/declining/stable/volatile classifications
- **Weapon Proficiency**: Per-weapon accuracy, damage, and kill tracking
- **Comparative Analysis**: Performance vs average pilot statistics
- **Improvement Recommendations**: AI-driven suggestions based on performance patterns

## Architecture Decisions

### Leverage Existing Systems
All implementations extend rather than replace existing foundation:
- **GameStateManager**: Enhanced with new states, maintains existing API
- **SaveGameManager**: Used for all persistence, no duplication
- **PlayerProfile/PilotStatistics**: Extended with new calculation methods
- **CampaignData/CampaignState**: Leveraged for all campaign operations

### Coordination Pattern
Higher-level coordination layers built on robust existing systems:
- **Data Persistence**: All handled by existing SaveGameManager
- **Asset Loading**: All through existing WCSAssetLoader
- **State Management**: Coordinated through existing GameStateManager
- **Resource Management**: Leverages existing wcs_asset_core systems

## Integration Points
- **EPIC-001**: Foundation systems (GameStateManager, SaveGameManager, etc.)
- **EPIC-006**: Menu & Navigation (PilotSystemCoordinator, UIThemeManager)
- **EPIC-004**: SEXP Expression System (campaign variables, mission conditions)
- **EPIC-002**: Asset Management (WCSAssetLoader for all resource operations)

## Status
- **FLOW-001 through FLOW-010**: Complete and validated
- **Architecture**: Approved and implemented following BMAD workflow
- **Quality**: All implementations validated with Godot syntax checking
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing foundation systems maintained
