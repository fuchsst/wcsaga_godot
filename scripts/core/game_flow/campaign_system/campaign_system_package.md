# Campaign System Package - FLOW-004 Implementation

## Package Overview
The Campaign System Package provides comprehensive campaign progression and mission unlocking functionality that leverages existing WCS Asset Core resources. This package coordinates campaign flow using existing `CampaignData`, `CampaignState`, and save system integration without duplicating functionality.

## Architecture
This package implements a coordination layer on top of existing robust resource systems:

- **CampaignProgressionManager**: Central coordinator leveraging existing CampaignData and CampaignState
- **MissionUnlocking**: Mission availability logic using existing campaign structure
- **ProgressionAnalytics**: Performance and progression analysis for player insights
- **SaveGameManager Integration**: Uses existing comprehensive save system
- **WCS Asset Core Integration**: Leverages existing campaign and mission resources

## Key Classes

### CampaignProgressionManager (Main Entry Point)

    MISSION_COMPLETION,  # Previous mission completed
    PERFORMANCE_UNLOCK,  # Performance threshold met
    CHOICE_UNLOCK,      # Player choice consequence
    VARIABLE_CONDITION, # Campaign variable condition
    BRANCH_UNLOCK       # Story branch condition
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Campaign Management
```gdscript
# Create campaign progression manager
var campaign_manager = CampaignProgressionManager.new()

# Load campaign using existing CampaignData resources
var success = campaign_manager.load_campaign("main_campaign.fsc", current_pilot)
if success:
    print("Campaign loaded successfully")

# Get available missions
var available_missions = campaign_manager.get_available_missions()
for mission_info in available_missions:
    if mission_info.is_available and not mission_info.is_completed:
        print("Available: ", mission_info.name, " (", mission_info.filename, ")")

# Complete a mission
var mission_result = {
    "success": true,
    "score": 5000,
    "time": 1200.0,
    "accuracy": 85.0
}
campaign_manager.complete_mission("mission_01.fs2", mission_result)
```

### Campaign State Management
```gdscript
# Set campaign variables using existing CampaignState system
campaign_manager.set_campaign_variable("pilot_reputation", 75, true)
campaign_manager.set_campaign_variable("mission_difficulty", "hard", false)

# Record player choices using existing choice system
campaign_manager.record_player_choice("spare_civilians", true, {"significant": true})

# Get campaign summary using existing state data
var summary = campaign_manager.get_campaign_summary()
print("Campaign: ", summary.campaign_name)
print("Progress: ", summary.completion_percentage, "%")
print("Missions completed: ", summary.missions_completed, "/", summary.total_missions)
print("Available missions: ", summary.available_missions)
```

### Mission Unlocking Logic
```gdscript
# Check mission availability
if campaign_manager.is_mission_available("secret_mission.fs2"):
    print("Secret mission is available")

# Connect to mission unlock signals
campaign_manager.mission_unlocked.connect(_on_mission_unlocked)

func _on_mission_unlocked(mission_id: String, unlock_reason: String):
    print("Mission unlocked: ", mission_id, " (Reason: ", unlock_reason, ")")
    show_mission_unlock_notification(mission_id)
```

### Performance Analytics
```gdscript
# Get progression analytics
var analytics = campaign_manager.progression_analytics
var summary = analytics.get_progression_summary(campaign_state)

print("Average mission time: ", summary.average_mission_time, " seconds")
print("Completion rate: ", summary.completion_rate * 100, "%")
print("Performance trend: ", summary.performance_trend.score_trend)

# Get mission-specific analytics
var mission_analytics = analytics.get_mission_analytics("boss_fight.fs2")
print("Mission attempts: ", mission_analytics.attempts)
print("Success rate: ", mission_analytics.success_rate, "%")
print("Best score: ", mission_analytics.best_score)

# Get improvement recommendations
var recommendations = analytics.generate_recommendations(campaign_state)
for recommendation in recommendations:
    print("Recommendation: ", recommendation.title)
    print("Priority: ", recommendation.priority)
    print("Description: ", recommendation.description)
```

## Integration Points

### Existing CampaignData Integration
```gdscript
# Leverages existing CampaignData structure without modification
# CampaignData.missions contains CampaignMissionData with:
# - mission.filename for identification
# - mission.formula_sexp for unlock conditions
# - mission.notes for additional requirements
# - mission.index for progression tracking

# Mission unlocking uses existing mission structure
func _evaluate_mission_unlock_conditions(mission_data: CampaignMissionData, ...):
    # Uses mission_data.formula_sexp for SEXP conditions
    # Uses mission_data.notes for performance/time requirements
    # Uses mission_data.index for linear progression
```

### Existing CampaignState Integration
```gdscript
# Uses existing CampaignState functionality completely
# CampaignState provides:
# - mission completion tracking with is_mission_completed()
# - campaign variable management with set_variable()/get_variable()
# - player choice recording with record_player_choice()
# - mission results storage in mission_results array
# - completion percentage calculation

# No modifications to CampaignState - pure coordination layer
campaign_state.complete_mission(mission_index, mission_result)  # Existing method
campaign_state.set_variable("story_flag", true, true)  # Existing method
campaign_state.get_completion_percentage()  # Existing method
```

### SaveGameManager Integration
```gdscript
# Uses existing comprehensive save system
# SaveGameManager provides:
# - save_campaign_state() for persistence
# - load_campaign_state() for restoration
# - Automatic backup and validation
# - Atomic save operations

func _save_campaign_progress():
    # Uses existing save system without modification
    SaveGameManager.save_campaign_state(current_campaign_state, save_slot)
```

### WCS Asset Core Integration
```gdscript
# Uses existing asset loading system
# WCSAssetLoader provides campaign data loading
current_campaign_data = WCSAssetLoader.load_asset("campaigns/" + campaign_filename)

# Uses existing validation and registry systems
var validation = WCSAssetValidator.validate_asset(current_campaign_data)
```

## Mission Unlocking Conditions

### Linear Progression
```gdscript
# Basic sequential unlocking
# Mission N+1 unlocks when Mission N is completed
func _check_prerequisite_completion(mission_data: CampaignMissionData, ...):
    if mission_data.index > 0:
        var previous_mission = campaign_data.missions[mission_data.index - 1]
        if previous_mission.filename == completed_mission:
            return true
```

### Performance-Based Unlocking
```gdscript
# Score or time-based requirements
# Extracted from mission notes: "score_required:5000" or "time_limit:300.0"
func _check_performance_requirements(mission_data: CampaignMissionData, mission_result: Dictionary, ...):
    if mission_data.notes.contains("score_required"):
        var required_score = _extract_score_requirement(mission_data.notes)
        return mission_result.get("score", 0) >= required_score
```

### Choice-Based Unlocking
```gdscript
# Player choice consequences
# Evaluated through SEXP formulas: "(= choice_variable true)"
func _evaluate_simple_choice_condition(formula: String, choice_id: String, choice_value: Variant):
    if formula.contains(choice_id) and formula.contains("=" + str(choice_value)):
        return true
```

### Branch-Based Unlocking
```gdscript
# Story branch requirements
# Extracted from mission notes: "branch:rebel_path"
func _check_branch_conditions(mission_data: CampaignMissionData, campaign_state: CampaignState):
    if mission_data.notes.contains("branch:"):
        var required_branch = _extract_branch_requirement(mission_data.notes)
        return campaign_state.current_branch == required_branch
```
